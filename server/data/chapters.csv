It's raining.,A $characterfull walks into the shop.,"The $character's order is brusque. ""I need fresh steel,"" $he say|says. ""I care little for the details; give me only the finest weapon you are able. I wish to see if this place's reputation for creativity is well-founded.""","*options
You look at the rods and ingots of different metals stacked away near the forge, and select a few. Then you go through the many drawers and shelves, picking out various smaller materials, and lay them out with the metals on your workbench.",Metal glows as you withdraw it from the forge. Sparks fly as you strike it with your hammer. Steam rises as you quench the blade. Hidden power grows as the sword begins to take shape.,"*image
Finally, the sword is finished! The blade is $blade. The grip is $grip. The crossguard is $crossguard.","When the $character returns to your shop, you have the sword ready. Wordlessly $he take|takes it, run|runs an eye up and down its length, then give|gives you a satisfied nod and exit|exits."
It is a hot day. The shade of your shop might give you some relief were it not for the blazing forge.,"A figure darkens the door for a moment, and a $characterfull approaches the counter.","You ask how you can help. ""Smithy, I'm going out into the wild to prove myself as a capable ranger. I need a fearsome blade to take the heads off some bugbears, and scare off the rest."" $He turn|turns $his head a bit to the side, keeping $his gaze fixed on you. ""They fear fire, you know.""","*options
You sit in your master's office, surrounded by papers and scrolls full of descriptions and diagrams, thinking about the $character's request. There is more information in this room than you can ever hope to read, but all of it seems maddeningly vague. Standing and heading back to the shop, you draw as much on the memories of your master at work as you do the confusing scrawlings left behind in this room as you gather the materials for your next piece of work.","You flatten out the metal over your anvil, fold it over, and flatten it again. You grind rough edges smooth and polish them to a shine. You set the various ornaments into place on the body of the weapon.","*image
You set down the completed weapon, giving a final inspection to the blade ($blade), crossguard ($crossguard) and grip ($grip).","You stand in the front of the shop, holding the finished weapon in your hand. You try a few cuts, striking downward as if with your hammer. The weight feels good. Later, the $character arrives. You hand $him the sword and watch as $he stand|stands in the same spot and sweep|sweeps the weapon with considerably more finesse than you did. ""The weight feels good,"" $he say|says. You feel a spark of pride."
"Snow falls all over the town, flakes drifting past your window.",You are sharpening some of your leatherworking tools under the awning outside your shop when a $characterfull appears before you.,"The figure is quiet for a moment. Then $he speak|speaks in an accent you don't recognize: ""I've travelled far and been through much. My sword... I lost it in the caves to the south and just barely escaped. I need to get it back, but I can't go unarmed. Can you make me something that will help me in those dark caverns?""","*options
After the $character leaves, you close your eyes and visualize the shape of your next work. You do your best to connect your knowledge of the materials in the shop with your customer's requirements, and plan how you will put them together. Soon you have a list of possibilities, and head into the storeroom to pick out the materials.","Hours and days pass as you mold the metal to the shape in your mind, and carve out its fittings. You assemble them with care, feeling the weapon's potential increase as each piece settles into place.","*image
Finally, the sword is finished! The blade is $blade. The grip is $grip. The crossguard is $crossguard.","When the $character returns to your shop, you have the sword ready. Wordlessly $he take|takes it, run|runs an eye up and down its length, then give|gives you a satisfied nod and exit|exits."
